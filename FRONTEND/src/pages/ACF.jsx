          ACF Alternate Disputes Redressal System to settle the disputes between
          promoter and allottee.
        </p>

        <p>
          As per Section 32 (g) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development)
          Act 2016, APRERA Real Estate Regulatory Authority must take measures to
          facilitate amicable conciliation of disputes between the promoters
          and the allottees through dispute settlement forums set up by the
          consumer or promoter associations.
        </p>

        <p>
          With this objective, it was proposed to establish APRERA - ACF
          (Amicable Conciliation Forum) that shall facilitate resolution of
          disputes amicably, thereby saving cost and time of litigation to
          parties and State, promoting greater public satisfaction with legal
          system and dispute resolution.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under the mechanism of the Forum, if the parties don’t reach a
          consensus, the allottee(s) will have the possibility to lodge a formal
          complaint against the builder via APRERA Portal.
        </p>
