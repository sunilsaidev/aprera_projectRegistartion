          <p>
            The real estate sector plays a catalytic role in fulfilling the need
            and demand for housing and infrastructure in the country. While this
            sector has grown significantly in recent years, it has been largely
            unregulated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Though the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provided recourse to buyers,
            it was inadequate to address all concerns. Therefore, the need for
            regulating the sector was emphasized, leading to the enactment of
            the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.
