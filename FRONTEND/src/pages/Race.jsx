          <p>
            With the government focus on bringing transparency and
            accountability in the Real Estate sector and with RERA coming into
            effect in several states, the onus is on the builders to meet
            project timelines and ensure quality work,  else face penalties. 
            RERA will have a strong positive effect on buyer sentiments, especially
             those looking to invest in the residential sector. Many developers have
              launched integrated townships that have a mix of villas and high-rise towers,
               along with commercial developments, transport and connectivity systems, 
               education institution, schools, parks, retail outlets, gymnasium, jogging tracks,
                indoor sports, and other amenities.Fortunately for the builder, the construction
                 sector is becoming more and more technologically advanced with new mechanizations, 
                 equipment and systems that are expediting construction, making it safer too, and 
                 enabling better quality work. In fact, the contruction industry is abuzz with advanced
                  products like tower cranes, mechanized scaffolding, concrete pumps, access platforms, etc.
                   At the same time, new construction techniques like drywall, PEB (Pre-engineered building )
                    and precast are being adopted for speedier completion of projects. Use of software for 
                    project design and management is also becoming essential for builders who want the best solutions for their projects for example: Building Information Modelling, Virtual reality in construction monitoring etc.,
          </p>
          <h3 className="race-sub-title">VR Innovation in Construction</h3>
          <h4>What is Virtual Reality?</h4>
          <p>Virtual reality is a computer simulated environment, accessed through stereoscopic goggles
             that include a variety of different tracking mechanisms that track the viewer's movement 
             in physical space, and matches those movements within the simulated 3D environment.
              Headsets display a stereoscopic image, viewed through built-in lenses that creates 
              the illusion of looking out into a space. 3D renderings of the environment are captured 
              in 'real-time' - which means the computer is processing and presenting a new rendering of
               the scene 60 to 120 times per second. This provides the viewer with a very realistic sense
                of what it would be like to inhabit the simulated environment, which is what makes it such
                 a powerful opportunity for architectural visualization.</p>
                 <h4>Why does it matter for Building Design and Construction?</h4>
                 <p>People have a very hard time visualizing architectural concepts. It's nearly impossible for most people to fully understand what an architectural space will be like by viewing 2D floor plans, illustrations, animations or scale models. These are all ultimately abstract and distorted ways of visualizing a design, and not at all representative of how we experience architecture in the real world. With virtual reality, we can gain a very holistic understanding of what the building will feel like before investing the massive amount of resources it takes to make it a reality. It's a lot easier to change a pixel than it is to move a brick wall after it's built. VR helps people understand architecture in a way nothing else comes close to, which we believe will ultimately lead to the creation of better, more efficient built environment.
Residential sales are another great area of opportunity for virtual reality going forward. Prospective homebuyers would be able to tour and customize a home before its purchase or even its construction, including options like layout and optional features, and even painting and furniture.
There is also an opportunity to use virtual reality for professional training, helping workers learn about potential risks on the job site in a virtual reality setting or training them on heavy equipment operation in a virtual environment without deploying or risking any material assets.

<h3 className="race-section-title">
  Real Time Context Capture Using Drones
</h3>

<p>
  Drones are highly effective at surveying, 3D modeling, performing
  inspections for safety and in places that are difficult or dangerous
  to reach, and giving real-time progress updates on a job site.
</p>

<p>
  Capturing site data today is costly, time-consuming and often dangerous.
  Drones can easily go where it’s inefficient or unsafe for field personnel,
  making it easier to accurately measure our world so we can better manage it.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">
  Uses for Drones in Construction Projects
</h4>

<p>
  <strong>Drone for Surveying:</strong> You can use drones to quickly survey
  your job site and build maps. Instead of using human resources, heavy
  machinery & expensive surveying tools that produce complex data, you can
  get the job done in half the time & money, with greater accuracy.
</p>

<p>
  This makes the task of creating very accurate maps and providing valuable
  data to numerous companies much easier. Information you acquire can be
  uploaded right away to a server, where it can be accessed by individuals
  all over the globe with proper authorization.
</p>

<p>
  Drones can reach high-risk areas and tightly-squeezed locations that are
  quite a bit harder to reach with a human crew.
</p>

<p>
  Project managers can also opt to use 3D laser scanners that fly over the
  designated region and give the surveyor quality images of what the terrain
  appears like.
</p>

<p>
  This data is then used in a process called GIS mapping, which creates a
  digital map through a mix of statistical analysis and cartography. These
  maps have very high definition and allow for viewing of specific information
  about an area that’s easy for the manager to access.
</p>

<p>
  As many national entities will soon offer delivery via drone, proprietors
  who are in the business of getting their goods quickly to customers will
  stand up and take notice of regulations that may change drastically in the
  days to come.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">Analyzing the Data</h4>

<p>
  Models such as high-resolution 3D types use browser-based technology so
  users can simply share by sending a link, and the client can then log in,
  view the data, and export it to any local entities if they need.
</p>

<p>
  For work on structures such as dikes and dirt containment, this is one way
  to very easily visualize the progress of the very important duties.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">Showing the progress to Clients</h4>

<p>
  When clients stay away from the job site and cannot afford to come to the
  site again & again and your current pictures are just not doing justice,
  drones can be an inventive way to show clients the progress of building,
  renovation or inspection.
</p>
{/* CLIENT VISUAL SUPPORT */}
<p>
  If clients are not able to come view the job site regularly, drones are very
  helpful in providing a visual standpoint that they wouldn't have seen from
  the ground.
</p>

<p>
  It is not just the task of showing the client what is happening if they
  can't be there, it can also help with projects that haven't even begun yet.
</p>

<p>
  Drones do a great job of giving designers and architects an idea of what
  putting an adjacent structure up will look like, and how the aesthetics
  will change a very large project in a community in regards to open space
  on the ground and upwards.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">Monitoring Job Sites</h4>

<p>
  When you have to frequently shuttle between multiple job sites, or have
  taken up simultaneous renovation & facelift for multiple properties,
  putting up a drone to monitor the progress, work, safety standards and
  much more can save you a lot of energy, time & money.
</p>

<p>
  When your workers are on a job site, the main objective that any project
  manager could wish for is keeping them productive. It is understandable
  that energy levels will ebb and flow, but you can also detect if any
  equipment shows up missing, or if other areas may need more workers
  designated to them for special accommodations.
</p>

<p>
  If safety standards are one of the elements you are trying to monitor, one
  important aspect to keep in mind is that you will be flying a bit low to
  the ground.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">Better Safety Records</h4>

<p>
  With your eyes & ears in the sky, all the time, you will be in a much better
  position to locate that unstable pillar, precariously balanced laborer and
  not deep enough excavations.
</p>

<p>
  If you keep up the drone-survey, gradually you will build an excellent
  safety system and your reputation.
</p>

<p>
  Drones in construction can do a great job of hovering over a location that
  is too dangerous for a worker to get to, and can save lives by monitoring
  workplace conditions in areas that are very hard to reach.
</p>

<p>
  In manufacturing plants, drones can help with reconnaissance, sending
  images of what kind of conditions can be expected before a worker is
  dispatched.
</p>

<h3 className="race-section-title">Building Information Modelling</h3>

<p>
  BIM or Building Information Modelling is a process for creating and managing
  information on a construction project across the project lifecycle. One of
  the key outputs of this process is the Building Information Model, the
  digital description of every aspect of the built asset.
</p>

<p>
  This model draws on information assembled collaboratively and updated at
  key stages of a project. Creating a digital Building Information Model
  enables those who interact with the building to optimize their actions,
  resulting in a greater whole life value for the asset.
</p>

<p>
  BIM data can be used to illustrate the entire building life-cycle, from
  cradle to cradle, from inception and design to demolition and materials
  reuse.
</p>

<p>
  Spaces, systems, products and sequences can be shown in relative scale to
  each other and, in turn, relative to the entire project. By signaling
  conflict detection, BIM prevents errors creeping in at the various stages
  of development and construction.
</p>

  Challenges Of Indian Real Estate Sector
</h3>
{/* CHALLENGES OF INDIAN REAL ESTATE SECTOR – DETAILS */}

<p>
  The main challenges faced by Indian building industry are significant
  schedule and cost overrun, which is mainly occurring due to wastage of
  material, poor coordination, significant rework and lack of information
  sharing. Let us point the main issues faced by firms involved in built
  environment as follows.
</p>

<ul className="race-list">
  <li>Changes in design</li>
  <li>Time, work effect consumption</li>
  <li>Higher possibilities for error and rework</li>
  <li>Increasing input costs</li>
  <li>Deficiency of skilled labor that result in high risks for workers</li>
  <li>Construction cost estimations</li>
  <li>Anxieties on the quality and productivity of the project</li>
  <li>Lack of organization of market</li>
  <li>Rare virtual environment work</li>
</ul>

<h3 className="race-section-title">
  Influence Of Technology In Real Estate Sector
</h3>

<p>
  The bigger challenges faced by the real estate sector can be solved up to a
  limit with the emergence of technologies like BIM models. A lot of
  different IT-enabled project management tools have been introduced in the
  real estate market.
</p>

<p>
  These tools help ensure more efficient project delivery and act as a
  catalyst to change real estate companies in India and redefine their space
  in the country for both now and the future.
</p>

<p>
  Technology enables tremendous changes in areas like construction, project
  management, business management, marketing and customer service.
</p>

<h3 className="race-section-title">
  How BIM Modeling Benefits To Real Estate Sector
</h3>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">
  BETTER OUTPUT THROUGH BIM COLLABORATION
</h4>

<p>
  BIM creates a collaborative working relationship among all project partners
  including various design disciplines, contractors, specialists, suppliers
  and customers, using a single shared 3D model.
</p>

<p>
  As a result, everybody involved in the project will focus on achieving best
  value throughout the project from inception to eventual decommissioning.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">OPTIMIZED PERFORMANCE</h4>

<p>
  BIM enables seamless coordination among all stakeholders by using a shared
  digital model, allowing teams to detect conflicts early and optimize
  performance across all project stages.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">BETTER FORECAST</h4>
{/* BIM BENEFITS – CONTINUATION */}

<p>
  Using BIM, project teams can build the project in a virtual environment
  before construction starts. This virtual model rehearses complex procedures,
  optimizes temporary works and plans procurement of materials, manpower and
  equipment.
</p>

<p>
  As BIM can provide owners and operators with a visual representation of the
  project at an early stage, they get a clear idea about the design intent.
  This enables them to suggest modifications in the design to achieve the
  desired output.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">QUICK PROJECT TURNAROUND</h4>

<p>
  As BIM allows changes in design concepts at early stages of the project,
  last-minute design changes can be avoided. It uses standard design elements,
  helping resolve complex construction details before the project starts.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, BIM produces fabrication and construction drawings from the model,
  uses data to control construction equipment, checks design integrity and
  estimates quantities. All these features help the construction industry save
  time up to 50%.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">ENHANCED SAFETY MEASURES</h4>

<p>
  Designs using BIM can optimize public safety with the help of crowd behavior
  and fire modeling capabilities. Asset managers can enhance operational
  safety using the 3D model.
</p>

<p>
  Contractors can also review complex details or procedures before the project
  starts, reducing construction risks significantly.
</p>

<h4 className="race-sub-heading">
  ELIMINATION OF ERRORS AT EARLY DESIGN STAGE
</h4>

<p>
  A single 3D model integrates multidisciplinary design inputs, enabling
  identification and resolution of interface issues prior to construction.
</p>

<p>
  This eliminates chances of redesign, saves time and costs, and allows
  seamless integration of existing and new assets.
</p>

<h3 className="race-section-title">
  Scope Of Using BIM To Link Property Data In RERA
</h3>

<p>
  Building Information Modelling (BIM) offers rich opportunities for property
  professionals to use information throughout the property life cycle. BIM
  assists in managing design and construction data through virtual
  construction.
</p>

<p>
  Expanding access to BIM can enable property professionals to utilize relevant
  data that improves the quality and accuracy of professional services.
</p>

<ul className="race-list">
  <li>
    BIM has the potential to link digitized property data to the Real Estate
    Regulatory Authority.
  </li>
  <li>
    A simple initial system could be created to ascertain the value of data
    (cost, quantity and quality).
  </li>
  <li>
    Over time, availability of data could be extended to allow access for
    buyers and other real estate professionals, improving efficiency,
    transparency and accountability.
  </li>
  <li>
    BIM provides spatial and visual accuracy of virtual building models, helping
    regulatory authorities and buyers verify that the intended design is
    actually built.
  </li>
  <li>
    As more property stock is delivered and maintained via BIM-enabled
    processes, corporate real estate professionals and surveyors can offer
    more accurate advice and services.
  </li>
  <li>
    BIM enables cost and quantity estimation at various phases of construction,
    making it easier for builders to plan cost requirements at each stage.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 className="race-section-title">Building Automatic Systems</h3>

<p>
  A big trend in the construction industry today is retrofitting updated
  buildings with more advanced structures. Retrofitting involves adjusting
  or replacing old infrastructure in existing buildings with new technology
  to improve performance.
</p>

<p>
  This could include numerous internal upgrades such as replacing lighting
  systems, installing internal climate sensors and outfitting the building
  with a state-of-the-art building automation system.
</p>

<p>
  A building automation system, or BAS, is a centralized control system which
  monitors an entire building’s functionality including heating, ventilation,
  air conditioning (HVAC), lighting systems, and water, fire and life safety.
</p>

<p>
  In outdated buildings, these systems are often not interconnected, which
  can lead to energy waste. Many contractors are now decreasing inefficiencies
  by integrating all of these functions into a unified system, which often
  drives down building costs as well as energy consumption.
</p>

<p>
  Despite reluctance by some in the construction industry to change, consumer
  pressure to keep up with demand of smart designs and structures will
  ultimately dictate a shift to new technologies for many companies.
</p>

<p>
  Companies that adapt and adopt these practices will be the ones that thrive
  as the industry evolves. The construction industry, like many others, is on
  the brink of a shift in the way business and operations are carried out.
</p>

<h3 className="race-section-title">
  E-Commerce Site For Construction Materials
</h3>

<p>
  The value of materials required to be purchased and used for any construction
  contract makes up a large proportion of a project’s total contract sum.
  Typically, materials account for 40–45% of the cost of all construction work.
</p>

<p>
  Maintaining an efficient and effective material procurement system, as well
  as procuring materials at the right price, quality and time, is essential
  for contractors to remain competitive in today’s environment.
</p>

<p>
  The emergence of internet technology has enabled information to be shared
  and exchanged through a common global network in an efficient and relatively
  low-cost environment. Many companies are now conducting their business using
  web-based e-commerce systems.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, it has been suggested that e-commerce can provide a win–win
  situation for both suppliers and buyers, as it offers an expanded
  marketplace where they can communicate directly with each other.
</p>

<p>
  Online construction trading markets are not limited by physical store
  spaces and can carry a much larger variety of products, ranging in style
  and size. Buyers can search a wide range of products with low transaction
  costs at any time convenient to them.
</p>

<p>
  Most importantly, direct communication between buyers and suppliers
  eliminates the multiple middlemen that often exist between the two.
  Consequently, products can be purchased at lower prices and delivered
  quicker to the purchaser.

    <p>
      Software engineering models and methods impose structure on software
      engineering with the goal of making that activity systematic, repeatable,
      and ultimately more success-oriented. Using models provides an approach
      to problem solving, a notation, and procedures for model construction and
      analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Methods provide an approach to the systematic specification, design,
      construction, test, and verification of the end-item software and
      associated work products. Software engineering models and methods vary
      widely in scope—from addressing a single software life cycle phase to
      covering the complete software life cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a successful construction project, as-built progress should be
      constantly monitored and compared with the as-planned construction
      progress, and real-time corrective actions should be taken in case of
      observed discrepancies.
    </p>

    <p>
      A series of conceptual visualization techniques (e.g., augmented reality,
      color and color gradient) have been recently developed to facilitate the
      communication of progress information and decision making on corrective
      actions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Camera matching and registration of the as-planned model with as-built
      photographs, analyzing progress status through material-based detection
      techniques, and generation of occlusion-free photographs are applied to
      further improve and facilitate these processes.
